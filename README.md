The program was tested on both Windows and Mac systems, and work perfectly. Our program is not a state-of-the-art chatroom but it does its purposes. The Thanksgiving break was tough for us since we couldn't get together, and that is why our program looks so simple. If we would've more time we would've added a username text field, and a connect button to start the thread and identify the one who is speaking a little better since we will have been assigning an "id" to the user. We would aslo had add an exit button and a disconnect button, and maybe create a separate chat window to communicate with single users. 
We had to take a slip day since we couldn't work during the break because one of our teammates suffered the loss of a loved one. Testing was performed from Monday (11/28) till Wednesday(11/30). The testing was divided in two sections:
- client tests
- server tests
Manuel performed the client tests as to see whether the console was outputting what was sending and if every function worked effectively.
Rodolfo performed the server tests to check if it could see all the users connected, and divide the work effectively across every user.

We both tested the overall functionality by communicating from each computer, which it worked!
